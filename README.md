# x520 reverse engineering notes

> **Reference Spec:** [Intel® 82599 10 Gigabit Ethernet Controller Datasheet (Rev 3.5)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/331520/intel-82599-10-gigabit-ethernet-controller-datasheet.html)

A central archive for reverse-engineering the Intel X520 (specifically Intel X520-DA2, 82599 Chipset, explicitly stated due to the dozens of different OEM versions ). Contains raw hardware logs, experimental kernel patches, and documentation of undocumented edge cases found on consumer platforms. No marketing fluff, just raw silicon behavior.
